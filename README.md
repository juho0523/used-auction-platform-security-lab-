# Used Auction Platform Security Lab

This repository documents a practical security analysis project focused on
reviving a legacy Java web application and evaluating its security risks
through attack and defense scenarios.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:
- Identify security and operational risks in legacy systems
- Analyze root causes of environment and configuration failures
- Simulate realistic web application attack scenarios
- Apply defensive measures and evaluate their effectiveness

## Background

Many enterprise systems still rely on legacy Java-based web applications
and complex on-premise environments.
This project uses an old auction platform implemented with
Apache Tomcat and Oracle XE as a case study for security risk analysis.

## Scope

- Legacy Java web application (Eclipse-based)
- Apache Tomcat 8
- Oracle XE (native installation and container-based attempts)
- Windows-based development environment
- Web application security testing and hardening

## Repository Structure

- 00-environment-issues: Environment setup failures and root cause analysis
- 01-environment-rebuild: Infrastructure recovery using alternative approaches
- 02-project-revival: Restoring the legacy application
- 03-attack-scenarios: Web application attack simulations
- 04-defense-hardening: Defensive measures and security improvements
- 05-lessons-learned: Final analysis and conclusions

## Security Approach

This project follows a risk-oriented security approach:
1. Identify potential vulnerabilities and environmental risks
2. Reproduce attack scenarios in a controlled environment
3. Analyze the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
4. Apply defensive controls and reassess residual risks

## Status

This project is a work in progress.
Each phase is documented incrementally with detailed analysis and evidence.
